            <h3>Variable Description</h3>
            <p>SAMPLE identifies the IPUMS sample from which the case is drawn. Each sample receives a unique 6-digit code. The codes are structured as follows:</p>
            <p>The first four digits are the year of the census/survey.</p>
            <p>The next two digits identify the sample within the year.
For most censuses, IPUMS has multiple datasets which were constructed using different sampling techniques (i.e. size/demographic of the sample population, geographic coverage level or location, or duration of the sampling period for the ACS/PRCS samples).  </p>
            <p>The availability table for each variable indicates whether that variable is available in only certain samples for a given year. For further discussion of sample differences, see "Sample Designs.".</p>
            <p>Note: SAMPLE replaces DATANUM. Though the last two digits in SAMPLE do not correlate exactly with the now-deprecated DATANUM, the variable serves the same purpose of assigning a unique id to all cases that belong to the same dataset.</p>

            <p>It is generally a good idea to use HHWT when conducting a household-level analysis of any IPUMS sample. The use of HHWT is optional when analyzing one of the "flat" or unweighted IPUMS samples. Flat IPUMS samples include the 1% samples from 1850-1930, all samples from 1960, 1970, and 1980, the 1% unweighted samples from 1990 and 2000, the 10% 2010 sample, and any of the full count 100% census datasets. HHWT must be used to obtain nationally representative statistics for household-level analyses of any sample other than those.</p>
            <p>Users should also be sure to select one person (e.g., PERNUM = 1) to represent the entire household.</p>

            <h3>Variable Description</h3>
            <p>PUMA identifies the Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) where the housing unit was located. PUMAs are the smallest geographic units identified in Public Use Microdata Samples since 1990 for both the decennial censuses and the ACS/PRCS. To help maintain the confidentiality of respondents in public use microdata, every PUMA must, by design, have at least 100,000 residents at the time of the corresponding census. </p>
            <p>IPUMS has also created PUMAs for the 1960 5% sample, which each correspond approximately to one or more 2000 PUMAs using a minimum population threshold of 50,000.</p>
            <p>Note: PUMA codes are state-dependent. The PUMA codes for 1990 and later samples are unique only within each state, so a single code may identify different PUMAs in different states. To uniquely identify all PUMAs, it is necessary to combine the PUMA variable with a state identifier (STATEFIP or STATEICP). The IPUMS-defined 1960 PUMA codes are unique across all states and do not have this requirement.</p>
            <p>The Census Bureau updates PUMA definitions with each decennial census, so PUMA codes may or may not identify consistent areas over longer periods of time. See the Comparability section for information about which PUMAs are used in each sample. See the Codes section for information about each set of PUMA definitions.</p>
            <p>Note: PUMA definitions vary within some multi-year samples. In multi-year ACS samples that span a PUMA definition change, the identified PUMAs vary based on the survey year when each respondent was interviewed (as given by MULTYEAR). For example, in the 2010-2014 5-year ACS sample, the PUMAs identified for 2010 and 2011 respondents are 2000 PUMAs while the PUMAs identified for 2012-2014 respondents are 2010 PUMAs.</p>
            <p>In 1980 samples, "county groups" (CNTYGP98) are functionally similar to PUMAs with the same minimum population threshold of 100,000. In fact, "county group" is a misnomer because 1980 county groups, like PUMAs, typically subdivide large-population counties into smaller areas (though 1980 county groups still do not subdivide cities within counties as PUMAs do). In contrast, the county groups in 1970 samples (CNTYGP97) nearly all correspond to groups of one or more counties with a minimum population threshold of 250,000. In 1940 and 1950 samples, the identified geographic areas most like PUMAs are State Economic Areas (SEA).</p>

            <p>PUMA is a 5-digit numeric variable identifying the Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) where the housing unit was located.</p>
            <p>In all samples but 1960, PUMA codes are state-dependent. To uniquely identify all PUMAs in 1990 or later samples, the codes must be read in combination with one of the STATE variables: STATEFIP or STATEICP.</p>
            <p>As explained in the Description and Comparability sections, PUMA definitions are updated every ten years and therefore vary across samples and within some multi-year samples. IPUMS provides maps, composition files, and boundary files describing each set of PUMA definitions through the links below.

            <h3>Variable Description</h3>
            <p>GQ classifies all housing units as falling into one of three main categories: households, group quarters, or vacant units. It also identifies fragmentary sample units for 1850-1930 (see below). In all years, the data available about a person and their co-residents depend on whether the person lives in a household or in group quarters. Households are sampled as units, meaning that everyone in the household is included in the sample, and most household-level variables are available. People living in group quarters are generally sampled as individuals; other people in their unit may or may not be included in the sample, and there is no way of linking co-residents' records to one another. If, however, a sampled person in group quarters was living with relatives, the related group was sampled for 1850-1930. Most household-level variables are not available for group quarters or for vacant units.</p>
            <p>Group quarters are largely institutions and other group living arrangements, such as rooming houses and military barracks. The definitions vary from year to year, but the pre-1940 samples have generally used a definition of group quarters that includes units with 10 or more individuals unrelated to the householder. See the comparability discussion below and "Sample Designs" for more details about changing definitions of group quarters.  Group-quarters types are identified in further detail by GQTYPE and GQFUNDS.</p>

            <h3>Variable Description</h3>
            <p>VALUEH reports the value of housing units in contemporary dollars. For 1930, 1940, and from 2008 onward, VALUEH is a continuous variable. The other years report the midpoint of an interval; see codes and frequencies for intervals.</p>
            <p>User Note: Universe shifts and changing methods of determining value complicate use of this variable for comparisons across years. Furthermore, dollar amounts were intervalled differently for each year, and the top codes changed. Users must adjust for the effects of inflation; see INCTOT for Consumer Price Index adjustment factors.</p>
            <p>User Note: The traditional unit of land area in Puerto Rico is the cuerda. The cuerda is equal to about 3930 square meters, 4700 square yards, or 0.971 acres. Because the cuerda and the acre are so close to being equal, they are often treated informally as being equal. Mainlanders sometimes call the unit the "Spanish Acre." The IPUMS has preserved the units for the mainland U.S. as acres and Puerto Rico as cuerdas.</p>

            <p>The Census Bureau released revised data for the 2008 and 2006-8 multiyear ACS in November 2010.

            <p>We provide the original values in BEDROOMSORIG so that users can analyze the differences in the revisions or replicate previous analyses. However, we recommend that users analyze the revised variable BEDROOMS in their research.</p>

After removing the "not applicable" category (coded 00), to get the actual number of bedrooms, users must subtract 1 from the value of BEDROOMS.</p>

(1) Parent, Parent-in-law(2) Householder, Spouse, Sibling, Sibling-in-law(3) Child, Child-in-law(4) GrandchildThe number of generations is simply the number of these categories represented in the household.</p>
            <p>Second, the family inter-relationship pointer variables were examined to provide additional information on "other relatives" and nonrelatives of the householder. For example, two generations exist when someone is linked to a parent as identified by POPLOC and MOMLOC; three generations exist when that parent also has a parent in the household. Family interrelationship pointer variables were not able to be created in the 2010 Decennial Census.  As a result, multigenerational households can only be identified through the Census Bureau's definitions.</p>

As a result, multigenerational households can only be identified through the Census Bureau's definitions.</p>

            <p>PERWT indicates how many persons in the U.S. population are represented by a given person in an IPUMS sample. </p>
            <p>It is generally a good idea to use PERWT when conducting a person-level analysis of any IPUMS sample. The use of PERWT is optional when analyzing one of the "flat" or unweighted IPUMS samples. Flat IPUMS samples include the 1% samples from 1850-1930, all samples from 1960, 1970, and 1980, the 1% unweighted samples from 1990 and 2000, the 10% 2010 sample, and any of the full count 100% census datasets. PERWT must be used to obtain nationally representative statistics for person-level analyses of any sample other than those.</p>
            <p>For further explanation of the sample weights, see "Sample Designs" and "Sample Weights". See also HHWT for a corresponding variable at the household level, and SLWT for a weight variable used with sample-line records in 1940 and 1950.</p>

            <p>SFRELATE indicates the relationship of people within their subfamily. Persons not in a subfamily are assigned a value of 0.  </p>
            <p>The Census Bureau assigns a "reference person" to each subfamily. In married-couple subfamilies, this is the husband; in parent-child subfamilies, this is the parent. Reference persons are contained within a single relationship category in SFRELATE, as are all children.  All relationships can be further distinguished by using SFTYPE, which identifies the type of subfamily to which each person belongs.</p>
            <p>When studying subfamily-level characteristics (such as total subfamily income or the number of female-headed subfamilies), users should use the reference person's PERWT.  </p>
            <p>For more information on subfamilies and their measurement, see the Subfamily Overview page.</p>

            <p>RELATE describes an individual's relationship to the head of household or householder. Beginning in 1880, data on household relationship was asked of every person. The general relationship code is reasonably comparable across years. The detailed code makes distinctions that cannot be made in all years.</p>
            <p>The relationship codes are divided into two categories: relatives (codes 1-10) and non-relatives (codes 11-13). In general, the codes for relatives are self-explanatory. The non-relative codes are divided into three groups: "Partner, Friend, Visitor," roughly described as persons who do not pay or work for their accommodations (unless they share ownership); "Other Non-Relatives," including those persons paying or working for accommodations; and "Institutional Inmates." See the comparability discussion for further information about the coding scheme.</p>
            <p>RELATE is not available for 1850-1870, but the IPUMS variable IMPREL produces similar results.  As a convenience, the extract system is set up so that users may include RELATE in extracts of the 1850-1870 samples.

            <h3>Variable Description</h3>
            <p>The concept of race has changed over the more than 150 years represented in IPUMS. Currently, the Census Bureau and others consider race to be a sociopolitical construct, not a scientific or anthropological one. Many detailed RACE categories consist of national origin groups. With the exception of the 1970-1990 Puerto Rican censuses, RACE was asked of every person in all years. </p>
            <p>Beginning in 2000, the race question changed substantially to allow respondents to report as many races as they felt necessary to describe themselves. In earlier years, only one race response was coded. Beginning in 2020, the Census Bureau updated the questionnaire text, processing, and coding of the race and Hispanic origin questions, resulting in major changes to the distribution of race and Hispanic origin categories. As a result, users should proceed with caution when comparing RACE and HISPAN in 2019-prior samples with 2020-onward samples. See the comparability tab for more details. </p>
            <p>IPUMS offers several variables describing the answer(s) to the race question. RACE provides the full detail given by the respondent and/or released by the Census Bureau; it is not always historically compatible (see comparability discussion below). Users primarily interested in historical compatibility should consider using RACHSING. RACHSING codes race and Hispanic origin responses into a simple, historically compatible scheme that includes only federally defined race and Hispanic origin groups. Please note that RACESING, an earlier version of RACHSING, is also available on the IPUMS website. </p>
            <p>In addition, specific combinations of major races can be discerned using the following bivariate indicators of whether a particular race group was reported: RACAMIND, RACASIAN, RACBLK, RACOTHER, RACPACIS, and RACWHT. RACNUM indicates the total number of major race groups reported for an individual. The information contained in the bivariate indicators and in RACNUM is integrated into the detailed version of RACE. </p>
            <p>Prior to 1960, the census enumerator was responsible for categorizing persons and was not specifically instructed to ask the individual his or her race. In 1970 and later years, an individual's race was reported by someone in the household or group quarters. In the 1990 U.S. census, the 2000 U.S. and Puerto Rican censuses, the ACS, and the PRCS respondents were specifically asked what race the person "considers himself/herself" to be, although such self-description was more or less operative since 1960.</p>
            <p>User Note: Race questions were not asked in the Puerto Rican censuses of 1970, 1980, and 1990.  They were asked in the 1910 and 1920 Puerto Rican censuses, the 2000-2010 Puerto Rican censuses, and the PRCS.</p>

            <p>The HISPAN general code covers country-of-origin classifications common to all years; the detailed code distinguishes additional groups and subgroups. See HISPRULE for details on how country of origin information was assigned prior to 1980. </p>
            <p>In 2020, the Census Bureau updated the questionnaire text, processing, and coding of the race and Hispanic origin questions, resulting in major changes to the distribution of race and Hispanic origin categories. As a result, users should proceed with caution when comparing HISPAN and RACE in 2019-prior samples with 2020-onward samples. See the comparability tab for more details.</p>
